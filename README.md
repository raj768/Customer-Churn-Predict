# Customer Churn Prediction using NLP and ANN
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). We have implemented an end-to-end NLP pipeline to analyze customer sentiments and achieve an 85% accurate customer churn prediction.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical concern in the telecom industry. Understanding customer sentiments is crucial for predicting and reducing churn rates. This project combines NLP and ANN to analyze customer feedback and make accurate churn predictions.

## Data Wrangling
In the initial stages of the project, we perform data wrangling to prepare the telecom customer data for analysis. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.

## NLP Pipeline
Our NLP pipeline includes text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and feature extraction from customer feedback. We utilize techniques such as tokenization, stopwords removal, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform unstructured text data into valuable features.

## Neural Network
To predict customer churn, we employ an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The network is trained on the features extracted from the NLP pipeline and customer-related data. We fine-tune the model for optimal performance.

## Results
Our trained ANN model achieves an accuracy of 85% in predicting customer churn, which is a significant achievement in the telecom industry. We provide detailed analysis and visualizations of the results in our Jupyter Notebook.
